### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Texas at Austin's LIVE lab under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Alan C Bovik. I have also earned a master's degree from IIT Hyderabad and enriched my experience by working for a year and a half at Intel Labs. This experience enabled me to hone my skills and gain practical knowledge in these areas. Besides academic and professional pursuits, I am an enthusiastic sportsperson, and I enjoy playing cricket, badminton, and table tennis in my leisure time. Please feel free to reach out to me at my LinkedIn profile: www.linkedin.com/in/rajesh-sureddi
